== Error handled ==
1) Multiple &t error
2) Wrong command error
3) 

== Test cases ==
// to install the readline library
make install
// run the launch label in the makefile
make launch
// then write the following commands on the shell to test the CUSTOM SHELL
ls &t
cat assumption.txt
cd ..
ls -l
pwd
echo my name is lakshay
date
ls -l &t
mkdir hello
rm -f hello
